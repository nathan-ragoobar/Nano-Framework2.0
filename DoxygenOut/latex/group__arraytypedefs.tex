Eigen defines several typedef shortcuts for most common 1D and 2D array types.

The general patterns are the following\+:

{\ttfamily Array\+Rows\+Cols\+Type} where {\ttfamily Rows} and {\ttfamily Cols} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size square matrices or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size, and where {\ttfamily Type} can be {\ttfamily i} for integer, {\ttfamily f} for float, {\ttfamily d} for double, {\ttfamily cf} for complex float, {\ttfamily cd} for complex double.

For example, {\ttfamily Array33d} is a fixed-\/size 3x3 array type of doubles, and {\ttfamily Array\+XXf} is a dynamic-\/size matrix of floats.

There are also {\ttfamily Array\+Size\+Type} which are self-\/explanatory. For example, {\ttfamily Array4cf} is a fixed-\/size 1D array of 4 complex floats.

With \textbackslash{}cpp11, template alias are also defined for common sizes. They follow the same pattern as above except that the scalar type suffix is replaced by a template parameter, i.\+e.\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Array\+Rows\+Cols\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where {\ttfamily Rows} and {\ttfamily Cols} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4}, or {\ttfamily X} for fixed or dynamic size.
\item {\ttfamily Array\+Size\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} or {\ttfamily X} for fixed or dynamic size 1D arrays.
