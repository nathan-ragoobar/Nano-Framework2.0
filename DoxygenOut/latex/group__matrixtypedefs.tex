Eigen defines several typedef shortcuts for most common matrix and vector types.

The general patterns are the following\+:

{\ttfamily Matrix\+Size\+Type} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size square matrices or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size, and where {\ttfamily Type} can be {\ttfamily i} for integer, {\ttfamily f} for float, {\ttfamily d} for double, {\ttfamily cf} for complex float, {\ttfamily cd} for complex double.

For example, {\ttfamily Matrix3d} is a fixed-\/size 3x3 matrix type of doubles, and {\ttfamily Matrix\+Xf} is a dynamic-\/size matrix of floats.

There are also {\ttfamily Vector\+Size\+Type} and {\ttfamily Row\+Vector\+Size\+Type} which are self-\/explanatory. For example, {\ttfamily Vector4cf} is a fixed-\/size vector of 4 complex floats.

With \textbackslash{}cpp11, template alias are also defined for common sizes. They follow the same pattern as above except that the scalar type suffix is replaced by a template parameter, i.\+e.\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Matrix\+Size\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size square matrices or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size.
\item {\ttfamily Matrix\+XSize\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily Matrix\+SizeX\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for hybrid dynamic/fixed matrices.
\item {\ttfamily Vector\+Size\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily Row\+Vector\+Size\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} for column and row vectors.
\end{DoxyItemize}

With \textbackslash{}cpp11, you can also use fully generic column and row vector types\+: {\ttfamily Vector\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type,Size\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily Row\+Vector\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Type,Size\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}.
