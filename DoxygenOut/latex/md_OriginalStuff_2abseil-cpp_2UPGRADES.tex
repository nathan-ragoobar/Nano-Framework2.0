Abseil may occasionally release API-\/breaking changes. As noted in our \href{https://abseil.io/about/compatibility}{\texttt{ Compatibility Guidelines}}, we will aim to provide a tool to do the work of effecting such API-\/breaking changes, when absolutely necessary.

These tools will be listed on the \href{https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/tools/upgrades/}{\texttt{ C++ Upgrade Tools}} guide on \href{https://abseil.io}{\texttt{ https\+://abseil.\+io}}.

For more information, the \href{https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/tools/api-upgrades}{\texttt{ C++ Automated Upgrade Guide}} outlines this process.
